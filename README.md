A simple web browser extension that automatically converts all imperial units to metric units, on the D&D Beyond website.

Beyond Metric is available on [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/metric-beyond/id1662124385?l=en), [iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/metric-beyond/id1662124385?l=en), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metric-beyond/cihnlndlolbobejfmejjnagmohcbklff) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/metric-beyond/).

## About Metric Beyond

This project started after my players were concerned that because of imperial units they had a difficult time judging distances during our games. I searched around and found only one extension funnily named [Beyond Metric](https://github.com/bmarian/beyondMetric) but it was not maintained and was only available on Chrome. So for the pleasure of my players and you, dear reader, thus was created Metric Beyond. I will maintain it as long as I have the time and can pay the Apple Developer license.
